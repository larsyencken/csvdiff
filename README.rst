Overview
--------

Generate a diff between two CSV files on the command-line.

``csvdiff`` allows you to compare the semantic contents of two CSV files, ignoring things like row and column ordering in order to get to what's actually changed. This is useful if you're comparing the output of an automatic system from one day to the next, so that you can look at just what's changed.

It's also useful for maintaining patches to third-party data. Diffs generated by ``csvdiff`` are a subset of JSON and can be stored and applied using the matching ``csvpatch`` command. If upstream data changes, you can fetch the new version and re-apply your changes to it easily.

Installing
----------

You'll firstly need Python and pip. Then run::

    pip install csvdiff

Examples
--------

For example, suppose we have ``a.csv``::

    id,name,amount
    1,bob,20
    2,eva,63
    3,sarah,7
    4,jeff,19
    6,fred,10

After some changes and corrections to the data, we now have ``b.csv``::

    id,name,amount
    1,bob,23       <--- changed
    3,sarah,7
    4,jeff,19
    5,mira,81      <--- added
    6,fred,13      <--- changed

Now we can ask for a summary of differences::

    $ csvdiff --style=summary id a.csv b.csv
    1 rows removed (20.0%)
    1 rows added (20.0%)
    2 rows changed (40.0%)

Or look at the full diff pretty printed, to make it more readable::

    $ csvdiff --style=pretty --output=diff.json id a.csv b.csv
    $ cat diff.json
    {
      "_index": [
        "id"
      ],
      "added": [
        {
          "amount": "81",
          "id": "5",
          "name": "mira"
        }
      ],
      "changed": [
        {
          "fields": {
            "amount": {
              "from": "20",
              "to": "23"
            }
          },
          "key": [
            "1"
          ]
        },
        {
          "fields": {
            "amount": {
              "from": "10",
              "to": "13"
            }
          },
          "key": [
            "6"
          ]
        }
      ],
      "removed": [
        {
          "amount": "63",
          "id": "2",
          "name": "eva"
        }
      ]
    }

Diffs generated this way contain all the data that's changed, and can be reapplied later if the original data changes. For example, suppose more data gets added to ``a.csv``, giving us ``a-plus.csv``::

    id,name,amount
    1,bob,20
    2,eva,63
    3,sarah,7
    4,jeff,19
    6,fred,10
    8,henry,9

We can reapply our changes with the ``csvpatch`` command::

    $ csvpatch --input=diff.json --output=b-plus.csv a-plus.csv
    $ cat b-plus.csv
    id,name,amount
    1,bob,23
    3,sarah,7
    4,jeff,19
    5,mira,81
    6,fred,13
    8,henry,9

This can be useful if you're using csvdiff to transform data that's outside your control. In this case, you maintain the patch file and simply reapply it when the upstream data provider gives you a fresh file.

For more usage options, run ``csvdiff --help`` or ``csvpatch --help``.
